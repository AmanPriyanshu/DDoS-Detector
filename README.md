# DDoS-Detector
Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are a subclass of denial of service (DoS) attacks. A DDoS attack involves multiple connected online devices, collectively known as a botnet, which are used to overwhelm a target website with fake traffic. DDoS detection is the process of distinguishing distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks from normal network traffic in order to perform effective attack mitigation.
